# hello-world
shane0ooo repository

Welcome,
this is my page learing github. A Linux user very appreciative of opensourse and copyleft community.

Over the years have become more competant in my skills getting bits to work together. In that time have enjoyed a frustrated awe of the elegance of linux, enjoyed, and appreciated their countless hours of selfless contributions.

In this spirit I am happy to contribute in for others freely in the real meaning of 'Uni-verse-ity' (knowledge for all)

Aum on, Love in, peace out.
